# jiadesserts

A responsive, elegant, and user-friendly website for a friendâ€™s small business to showcase desserts and direct traffic to order forms.

## Background
This project started as a way for me to learn web development skills through hands-on, project-based learning. However, rather than just follow a tutorial, I wanted to create something meaningful, so I collaborated with a friendâ€™s small business and developed the website free of charge, turning it into both a learning experience and a way to provide real value.

## Features
- Designed and implemented a mobile-friendly, responsive layout for accessibility across devices  
- Developed structured sections for menu and product display to enhance user navigation  
- Deployed the site via GitHub Pages for reliable, cost-effective hosting and easy access  

## Tech Stack
- **HTML** and **CSS** for structure and styling  
- **JavaScript** for interactivity  
- **GitHub Pages** for deployment
